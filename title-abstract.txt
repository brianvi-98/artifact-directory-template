Title:
Coupled Autoencoders for Single-Cell Data Analysis

Abstract:
    Historically, analysis on single-cell data has been difficult to perform, due to data collection methods often resulting in the destruction of the cell in the process of collecting information. However, an ongoing endeavor of biological data science has recently been to analyze different modalities, or forms, of the genetic information within a cell. Doing so will allow modern medicine a greater understanding of cellular functions and how cells work in the context of illnesses. The information collected on the three modalities of DNA, RNA, and protein can be done safely and because it is known that they are same information in different forms, analysis done on them can be extrapolated understand the cell as a whole. Previous research has been conducted by Gala, R., Budzillo, A., Baftizadeh, F. et al. to capture gene expression in neuron cells with a neural network called a coupled autoencoder. This autoencoder framework is able to reconstruct the inputs, allowing the prediction of one input to another, as well as align the multiple inputs in the same low dimensional representation. In our paper, we build upon this coupled autoencoder on a data set of cells taken from several sites of the human body, predicting from RNA information to protein. We find that the autoencoder is able to adequately cluster the cell types in its lower dimensional representation, as well as perform decently at the prediction task. We show that the autoencoder is a powerful tool for analyzing single-cell data analysis and may prove to be a valuable asset in single-cell data analysis.
